Novogen.ai is a web platform that empowers scientists with tools to generate novel compounds with desired chemical descriptors.
The number of new pharmaceutical drugs approved by the FDA has been declining steadily whilst the cost and timeframe required to deliver new drugs to market have exponentially increased. In response to the increasingly difficult task of discovering new drugs for life-threatening diseases, we propose an online platform—novogen.ai—that allows individuals to query and devise combinations of unique molecules to serve as a basis for generating novel molecules with desired chemical descriptors.
